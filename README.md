# Simple Synchronous RAM Module (Verilog)

This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a simple synchronous Random Access Memory (RAM) module, designed for use with Xilinx FPGAs. It provides basic read and write operations, synchronized to a single clock signal.

**Description:**

This project demonstrates the development of a fundamental synchronous RAM module using Verilog. It's intended as a building block for more complex digital systems requiring data storage and retrieval. The design emphasizes clarity and simplicity, making it suitable for educational purposes and as a starting point for more advanced memory implementations.

**Features:**

* **Synchronous Read/Write:** All operations are synchronized to a single clock.
* **Basic Memory Operations:** Supports write and read operations based on address input.
* **Verilog Implementation:** Implemented using Verilog HDL.
* **Xilinx Compatibility:** Designed for synthesis and implementation on Xilinx FPGA platforms.
* **Modelsim Simulation:** Testbenches and simulation scripts included for verification using Modelsim.

**Functionality:**

* **Write Operation:** Data is written to a specified address when the `we` (write enable) signal is asserted on the rising edge of the clock.
* **Read Operation:** Data is read from a specified address on the rising edge of the clock when the `we` signal is de-asserted.

**Files:**

* `ram_module.v`: The Verilog source code for the RAM module.
* `ram_module_tb.v`: The testbench for simulating the RAM module.
* `modelsim_project/`: (Optional) Modelsim project files for simulation.
* `xilinx_project/`: (Optional) Xilinx project files for synthesis and implementation.
* `README.md`: This file.

**Tools Used:**

* Xilinx Vivado (for synthesis and implementation)
* Modelsim (for simulation and verification)

**Usage:**

1.  **Simulation (Modelsim):**
    * Open the Modelsim project (if provided) or create a new project.
    * Compile the Verilog source files (`ram_module.v` and `ram_module_tb.v`).
    * Run the simulation and analyze the results.
2.  **Synthesis and Implementation (Xilinx Vivado):**
    * Create a new Vivado project and add the Verilog source files.
    * Synthesize and implement the design for your target Xilinx FPGA.
    * Generate a bitstream and program the FPGA.

**Limitations:**

* This is a basic implementation and lacks advanced features.
* Memory size is limited by the register array implementation.
* No error detection or correction is included.

**Future Enhancements:**

* Implement larger memory capacities.
* Add asynchronous read/write support.
* Include error detection and correction mechanisms.
* Optimize for performance and resource usage.
* Implement different memory architectures.
